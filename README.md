    Who is the better batsman according to our model?


  We will check for following factors

  
  
  
  
1. Runs per innings = Total Runs/Total Innings

  
  
  
2.  SR = 100*(Total Runs/Total Balls)
  
  
3. 100's = sum(100's)
  
  
4.  50's = sum(50's)
  
  
5.  Team contribution = Player Runs/Team Runs (ex: Virat 50/ Team Ind 150 => 50/150 : 33%)
